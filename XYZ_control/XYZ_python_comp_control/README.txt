Path and command to run the XYZ:
C:\Users\ecestudent\Documents\GitHub\LIFSrProj_F15\XYZ_control\XYZ_python_comp_control>python Keylogger.py


To Run:

1. Run the program.
2. Set the port. The Arduino usually runs on COM5. The menu with the active ports list is in the top left corner of the GUI.
3. Set your distance.
KEY	1	2	3	4
DIST.	10	50	200	1500
4. From here, you can use the WASDRF controls.
W	back
A	left
S	forward
D	right
R	up
F	down

5. If you hit the 'x', 'y', or 'z' buttons, don't freak out. That's the diagnostic test for that axis. Give it six seconds and it'll be done.
